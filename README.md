**dCOI** is a platform that detects and visualizes delegate conflicts of interest across DAOs, empowering token holders with transparent risk metrics and informed voting decisions.

## Why dCOI?

DAOs are meant to decentralize governance, yet most rely on a small group of recurring delegates. The problem? These delegates often:

- Vote in **multiple DAOs** with overlapping interests
- Act without transparency on **external affiliations**
- Influence governance with **conflicts of interest**

**dCOI** solves this with:

- Conflict detection via cross-referenced delegate metadata
- Delegate scoring and risk metrics
- Dashboards that make conflicts easy to understand

---

## How dCOI Works

1. **Fetch Data**: Pull delegate info and vote histories via Tally API
2. **Cross-Reference**: Analyze across DAOs and platforms
3. **Detect Conflicts**: Identify overlaps and red flags
4. **Score & Rank**: Create a conflict scorecard per delegate
5. **Visualize**: Show all data via simple dashboards for users

## User Flow

1. User selects DAO ‚Üí Fetches delegates via Tally API
2. Delegate profiles are scored ‚Üí Based on CoI risk
3. User views detailed dashboards ‚Üí Conflicts, affiliations, voting patterns
4. (Future) Redelegate with 1 click or stake trust score
5. (Future) Scout submits proof of CoI ‚Üí Flag appears in delegate profile
